# 03. Voice & Tone: Warm Authority

## The Voice

We speak with the warm confidence of 500 years of hospitality. We are not desperate for attention; we simply *are*, and we're delighted to share it with you.
Our tone is:

* **Warm, not Cold**: We invite with open arms, not intimidating exclusivity.
* **Literary, not Commercial**: We tell stories, not sales pitches.
* **Substantial, but Joyful**: We have depth, and we want you to celebrate here.

Think of a host at a grand estate: polished, knowledgeable, genuinely pleased to have you, and excited for the celebration ahead.

## Copywriting Rules

### 1. Kill the Clichés (Gently)

* Avoid overused words: "Magical", "Fairy Tale", "Dream Day", "Charming".
* Prefer words with warmth AND weight: "Legacy", "Story", "Celebration", "History", "Your moment".

### 2. Use Evocative Rhythm

Make the text feel considered, not hurried.

* *Before*: "A beautiful place for your wedding."
* *After*: "Sun. Stone. Celebration. The ingredients of a moment that endures."

### 3. Frame Heritage as Invitation (Not Intimidation)

We describe who we *are*, and invite clients to become part of it.

* ❌ "You survive its beauty." (Intimidating)
* ✅ "Your story joins 500 years of stories." (Welcoming)
* ❌ "A severe stage for serious celebrations." (Cold)
* ✅ "Where history becomes your backdrop." (Warm)

## Cultural Translation Strategy

Translate *values*, not just words.

* **For the Spanish Client**: Sell **Tradition & Family Legacy**. "La herencia de su familia, en un escenario a la altura."
* **For the UK/US Client**: Sell **History & Celebration**. "Where your story joins centuries of stories."
* **For the French Client**: Sell **Terroir & Joy**. "L'esprit du lieu, prêt pour votre célébration."
* **For the Dutch/German Client**: Sell **Substance & Celebration**. "Echte geschiedenis. Echte viering."

## Key Messaging Pillars

* **Legacy**: "Your story deserves a setting with its own."
* **Joy**: "Where centuries of history meet your celebration."
* **Welcome**: "Now it's ready for yours."
