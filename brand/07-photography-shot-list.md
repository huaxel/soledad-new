# 07. Photography & Video Shot List

Guide for photographers and videographers to capture the brand aesthetic.

## The Aesthetic: "Editorial Chiaroscuro"

* **Mood**: Cinematic, dark, high-contrast.
* **Lighting**: Natural light. Prefer "Golden Hour" (dawn/dusk) and interior shadow play.
* **Edit Style**: Low exposure, warm shadows, lifted blacks (not crushed). Think "Renaissance painting".

## What to Avoid

* ❌ High-key, blown-out "sunny" photos.
* ❌ Cheesy posed smiles.
* ❌ Wide-angle fisheye distortion.
* ❌ Flash photography (kills the mood).
* ❌ Photos where the stone looks grey/blue (it should be warm).
