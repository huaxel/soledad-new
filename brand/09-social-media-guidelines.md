## Instagram Guidelines

### Visual Aesthetic

* **Feed**: Cohesive, dark, high-contrast. Every image should feel like part of the same film.
* **Stories**: More casual, but maintain the "Sevilla Black" background when adding text.
* **Reels**: Cinematic. Slow-mo. Trending audio is acceptable if it fits the mood.

### Content Pillars

1. **The Stage** (40%): Hero shots of the spaces. Light, shadow, texture.
2. **The Story** (30%): Historical anecdotes, quotes from the Manifesto, staff stories.
3. **The Celebration** (20%): Approved photos from real events. Always credit the photographer.
4. **The Season** (10%): Olive harvest, spring flowers, seasonal changes. Connect to the land.

### Caption Voice

* Short. Poetic. Evocative.
* End with a question or a call to feel, not a call to action.
* *Example*: "Shadow and silence. The ingredients of solitude. When was the last time you truly disconnected?"

### Hashtags (Standard Set)

```
#HaciendaLaSoledad #BodasEnSevilla #DestinationWeddingSpain #SevillaWedding #AndalusiaEvents #HeritageVenue #RawRefinement #ArquitecturaDelSilencio
```

## What to Avoid

* ❌ Memes, pop culture trends that feel cheap.
* ❌ Excessive emojis (max 1-2 per post).
* ❌ Overselling. We don't beg for attention; we command it.
* ❌ Sharing photos from vendors/events without proper credit.
* ❌ Reposting low-quality user-generated content.
