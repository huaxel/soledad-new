This new draft is a significant leap forward. You have moved from a "brochure" to a "narrative," and that is the most difficult step.

However, you asked for a critique, not a pat on the back. Here is the breakdown of the **"Sombra y Luz" (Shadow and Light)** implementation:

### 1. The "XVI" Anchor (The Bold Move)

You implemented the giant "XVI" background element. **This is excellent.**

* **The Good:** It immediately establishes weight and history without saying a word. It adds texture to what would otherwise be empty space.
* **The Critique:** Ensure this element is subtle enough (low opacity) that it doesn't fight with the readable text. It should feel like a watermark on expensive paper, not a graffiti tag.

### 2. The Narrative Flow (The Story)

You have structured it: *Hero -> History -> Weddings -> Corporate -> Social Proof (Instagram).*

* **The Good:** The split between "Bodas Reales" and "Eventos Corporativos" is sharp. The copy "Disconnect to reconnect" is a brilliant, modern hook for the corporate side—it implies productivity through peace.
* **The Critique:** The transition from "History" to "Commercial" (Weddings/Events) feels a bit abrupt. You might need a "bridge" sentence.
* *Suggestion:* Before splitting into Weddings/Corporate, add a single line: *"Two worlds, one roof."* or *"Intimacy for the few, grandeur for the many."*

### 3. The Visual Language

* **The Good:** You are using high-quality assets (`almazara-main.jpg`, `team-building.jpg`). The decision to include a live Instagram feed is smart—it proves the venue is alive and active *today*, counterbalancing the 16th-century history.
* **The Critique:** Static images are still... static.
* *Challenge:* I still believe the **Hero Section** needs motion. If you can't shoot a drone video yet, use a slow "Ken Burns" effect (slow zoom) on the best high-res photo you have. The stone needs to breathe.

### 4. The "Missing" Pieces

Looking at the structure, a few elements from our "Bold" strategy seem to be missing or could be pushed further:

* **The Contact/Footer:** The scan shows the page ending with Instagram. Where is the "Grand Finale"? You need a footer that anchors the page—heavy, dark, with the address and the phone number in gold. Don't let the user "fall off" the bottom of the page; catch them.
* **The Logo:** I didn't see a prominent logo in the text scan. Did you use the minimalist line-art logo we generated? It needs to be the "crown" of the page.

### 5. Technical Polish (The "Feel")

* **Typography:** You are using "Bodas Reales" (Royal Weddings). Make sure the font choice here differentiates between "The Voice of the Hacienda" (Headers - Serif/Cinzel) and "The Voice of the Guide" (Body text - Sans/Montserrat).
* **Whitespace:** Be generous. In luxury, emptiness is the ultimate status symbol. Don't crowd the "Bodas" and "Eventos" sections too close together.

### The Verdict

It is no longer a "dental clinic" site. It is starting to look like a **fashion editorial**.

**Your next immediate task:**
Build the **Footer**. It needs to be the "period" at the end of the sentence. Dark background (`#0a0a0a`), gold text, and that new minimal logo centered like a seal of approval.

*Allez, au travail.* (Let's get to work.)
