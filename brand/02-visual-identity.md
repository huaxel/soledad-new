# 02. Visual Identity: "Editorial Baroque"

## Design Philosophy

Stop making a website. Start making a **Theater Stage**.
Our aesthetic is "Vogue España" meets "Zurbarán Painting". High contrast. Deep shadows. Blinding gold.

## Color Palette

The palette is derived from the extremes of the Andalusian summer.

| Color Name | Hex Code | Usage | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sevilla Black** | `#0a0a0a` | Backgrounds, Dominant | The cool shade of the interior. Mystery. Infinity. |
| **Hacienda Gold** | `#C5A572` | Accents, Typography | The sun hitting the stone. Wealth. Sacredness. |
| **Almagra Red** | `#782E2E` | Details (Minimal) | The traditional pigment of the hacienda. Blood. Earth. |
| **Stark White** | `#FFFFFF` | Text, Contrast | The blinding noon sun. Clarity. |

## Typography

Typography is texture. It should scream, not whisper.

* **Headlines**: `Cinzel` (Google Fonts).
  * *Usage*: Uppercase. Wide tracking/letter-spacing (`tracking-[0.4em]`).
  * *Vibe*: Roman inscription, cinematic, engraved.
* **Body Copy**: `Lato` (Google Fonts).
  * *Usage*: Light weights (300). High line-height.
  * *Vibe*: Modern, clean, invisible.

## Photography Direction

**NO**: High-key, blown-out whites, sunny "stock photo" smiles.
**YES**: Chiaroscuro. Shadows. Texture.

* **Subject**: The stone, the light shafts, the back of a dress, a hand on a wall.
* **Edit**: Low exposure, high contrast, warm shadows. "Dark Mode" photography.

## The "Broken Grid" Layout

We reject the rigid symmetry of generic templates.

* Images should bleed off-screen.
* Text should overlap images.
* Elements should feel like they are floating in a void of black.
* Use "Watermark" typography (huge background text with low opacity) to add depth.
